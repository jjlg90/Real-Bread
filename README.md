### Skeleton
For the wireframes, Figma software has been used to lay out the foundations of the website.

Check out the [Wireframes](https://www.figma.com/file/HsCoAfn66Pcyj2mq59dF2S/Real-Bread) here!

### Surface
 The content is easy to navigate and is neatly divided in sections.

 There is two colour palettes, light and dark. Both were designed with the several stages of bread caramelization in mind.

 * Three shades of wheat.
 * Three shades of brown.
 * One shade of white.


The fonts are:
* Quattrocento for headers. Classic, elegant and sober. It reflects the calm process of bread making.
* Quattrocento Sans for content. Warm, readable and not intrusive.
