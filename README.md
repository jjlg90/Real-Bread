### Structure 

#### Information
 The content is grouped in 3 different sections
* Hero: Carousel of hero images with headers and information about sourdough. 
* Our Products: tabs with pictures and description of the different products.
* Our Locations: interactive google maps with marked bakery's locations.

### Skeleton
For the wireframes, Figma software has been used to lay out the foundations of the website.

Check out the [Wireframes](https://www.figma.com/file/HsCoAfn66Pcyj2mq59dF2S/Real-Bread) here!

### Surface
 The content is easy to navigate and is neatly divided in sections.

 There is two colour palettes, light and dark. Both were designed with the several stages of bread caramelization in mind.

 * Three shades of wheat.
 * Three shades of brown.
 * One shade of white.


The fonts are:
* Quattrocento for headers. Classic, elegant and sober. It reflects the calm process of bread making.
* Quattrocento Sans for content. Warm, readable and not intrusive.
